# Concurrency Lab Writeup

## Questions
*Answer the following questions:*
#### 1.  Explain how concurrency was implemented in your process and threadpool servers.


#### 2. How are zombie processes prevented, and what strategies or mechanisms address them in your approach?


#### 3.  Why are semaphores necessary for ensuring proper synchronization in the threadpool server? What would happen if the semaphores were improperly initialized or not used?


#### 4. How did you use semaphores to protect critical sections of your code in the threadpool server?


#### 5.  Explain potential performance differences between the process and threadpool implementations.


## Screenshots
*Insert the following screenshots:*

#### 1.  Process server code gcc compilation output showing no errors (see part 2)


#### 2.  Test driver output showing all tests passed for process server (see part 2)


#### 3.  Threadpool server code gcc compilation output showing no errors (see part 4)


#### 4.   Test driver output showing all tests passed for the threadpool server (see part 4)
